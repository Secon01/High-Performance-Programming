Optimization:
    Kept the first 4 iterations unchanged, removed all branches from the hot loop.
Correctness:
    abs_diff = 0 → correct.
Performance:
    f_std ≈ 0.40 s, f_opt ≈ 0.10 s
    Speedup: ~4×
Conclusion:
    Eliminating branches from the inner loop significantly improves performance by reducing branch overhead and enabling better pipelining
