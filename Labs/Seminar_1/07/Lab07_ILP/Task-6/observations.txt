Auto-vectorization:
    The inner loop of matvec_autovec was successfully auto-vectorized after removing the loop-carried dependency on vec_c[i] by using a scalar accumulator.
Compilation:
    Compiled with -O3 -march=native, enabling SIMD instructions supported by the CPU.
Correctness:
    Results match the reference implementation.
Performance:
    The auto-vectorized version runs significantly faster than the reference scalar version due to SIMD execution of the inner loop.
Conclusion:
    Writing loops with independent iterations enables the compiler to exploit ILP and SIMD through auto-vectorization, leading to clear performance gains.
