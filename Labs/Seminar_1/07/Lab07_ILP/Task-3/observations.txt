Optimization: loop fusion applied to apply_stencil_v2; extra: real blocking + fusion in v3.
Correctness: all versions correct (max_abs_diff ≈ 1e−15).
STENCIL_SZ = 20:
    v1 1.407 s, v2 0.736 s → ~1.9× faster
    v3 0.736 s → no gain over v2
STENCIL_SZ = 4:
    v1 0.093 s, v2 0.071 s → ~1.3× faster
    v3 0.069 s → marginally best
Explanation:
    Large stencil → loop overhead dominates → fusion helps.
    Small stencil → compiler optimizes short loops → benefit shrinks.
Extra (large GridPt):
    v2 0.881 s, v3 0.864 s → blocking helps slightly (~2%).
