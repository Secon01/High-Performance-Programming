Optimization:
    Manually unrolled the loop by 4 and removed the conditional by making the update of x explicit.
    f_std used as baseline.
Correctness:
    max_abs_diff = 0 → results are identical.
Performance:
    f_std: 0.087 s
    f_opt: 0.186 s
    f_opt is ~2.1× slower than f_std.
Compiler unrolling:
    Automatic/manual loop unrolling does not improve performance here.
Conclusion:
    Loop-carried dependencies and increased code complexity outweigh the benefit of reduced control flow, making the optimized version slower.
