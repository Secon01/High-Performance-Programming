bubble vs merge timings (few N)
merge leak version slower / gets worse with larger N (allocator/cache pressure)
single malloc improves over baseline (fewer malloc/free)
stack version: faster but fails after some N (stack limit from ulimit)
cutoff optimization: best cutoff found, small speedup
extra: work buffer once is fastest (no repeated allocations)
