Proportionally increase m --> new m = old n * (old n/ new n)

Runtime measurements show that ModifyLow() is consistently faster than ModifyWithStep8() for large n, despite both performing the same number of operations.
Cache information (sysctl) reports a 64 KB L1 data cache and a 128-byte cache line size. Each StructType is 512 bytes, so for n = 200 the working set (~100 KB) exceeds the L1 cache capacity.
ModifyLow() accesses contiguous memory and reuses cache lines efficiently, while ModifyWithStep8() accesses memory with a 64-byte stride, resulting in poor spatial locality and frequent cache misses.
When n is reduced and m is increased proportionally, the working set fits in L1 cache (around n ≈ 50), and the runtime difference between the two functions decreases, confirming that cache locality dominates performance.
