regularcode:
    Observation: user ≈ real, sys negligible.
    Explanation: The program is CPU-bound and single-threaded, so most time is spent executing user-level code.
mallocycode:
    Observation: sys time is significant.
    Explanation: Frequent dynamic memory allocations involve system-level operations.
sleepycode:
    Observation: real ≫ user.
    Explanation: sleep() increases wall-clock time without using CPU resources.
threadedcode:
    Observation: user > real.
    Explanation: CPU time is accumulated across multiple threads executing in parallel.
