Expectation
    FAST version should be faster because loop-invariant work is moved out of the inner loop.
    Compiler optimizations should further reduce execution time.
Measured results
    -O0: FAST version clearly faster than SLOW.
    -O2 / -O3: Execution time drops significantly for both versions.
    FAST often remains slightly faster, but the gap is much smaller.
Interpretation
    Manual loop-invariant removal reduces repeated operations.
    With optimizations enabled, the compiler performs similar transformations automatically.
Conclusion
    Results match expectations.
    Compiler optimizations dominate performance at -O2/-O3.
    Manual “FAST” optimizations matter most when compiler optimizations are disabled or limited.
