norms.c (normal floating-point values) consistently runs faster than denorms.c (denormal values).
Denormal numbers introduce a noticeable performance penalty at -O2 and -O3.
With -Ofast, the performance gap is reduced or disappears due to relaxed IEEE floating-point rules (e.g. flushing denormals to zero).
Results were evaluated using the minimum user time over 5 runs.
