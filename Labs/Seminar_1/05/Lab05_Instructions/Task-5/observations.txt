A real function call introduces overhead due to jumps, stack frame setup, and register saving/restoring.
Using inline allows the compiler to replace the function call with the function body, eliminating this overhead.
With -O2, the non-inlined version ran in 0.13 s, while the inlined version ran in 0.05 s (minimum user time).
With -O3, the non-inlined version again ran in 0.13 s, while the inlined version improved further to 0.04 s.
The results confirm that function inlining significantly improves performance in tight loops, and higher optimization levels amplify this effect.
