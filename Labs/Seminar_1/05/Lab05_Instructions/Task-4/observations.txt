memset.c
    Using memset/memmove is faster than manual loops, as library routines are highly optimized.
    The measured results match the expectation.
lookup.c
    Lookup tables outperform repeated computation when the input domain is small and values are reused.
    The lookup version was consistently faster, as expected.
strength_reduction.c
    Replacing expensive operations (division, multiplication by constants, floating-point division) with shifts, additions, and precomputed constants significantly reduced execution time.
    The optimized version produced identical results and ran faster.
math_functions.c
    Replacing pow() with sqrt() and sqrtf() improved performance.
    sqrtf() was fastest due to lower precision and simpler implementation.
timings.c
    Demonstrates how to measure execution time using time.h and shows that execution time increases with workload size.
Measurement method
    Each version was executed 5 times and the minimum user time was used for comparison.
